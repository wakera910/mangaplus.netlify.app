    <p>Naruto uzumaki understood zabuza momochi in that fated moment, and the entire world seemed to shift as his hand plunged into the man&#039;s heart, almost seeming to move in slow motion. In his hands is kubikiribocho. In his right ear on the top lobe are two studs one red and one black, along with a stud in the shape of a white fox skull that takes up most of the bottom lobe. A tattoo of a horned humanoid demon wielding a zanbato made of a black ice in the shape similar to zabuza&#039;s old zanbato. Naruto had wasted no time at all when zabuza told him to take it and saver her, now the blade seemed to be vibrating.</p>
